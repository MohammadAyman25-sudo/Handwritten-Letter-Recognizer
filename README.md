# Handwritten-Letter-Recognizer
This is a machine learning model used for Optical Character Recognition, Recognizing the handwritten english characters

using deep learning neural network I got the model to recognize the handwritten english characters with 97.25% accuracy

# Dataset
I've used a dataset from kaggle called A_Z Handwritten Dataset, the data consists of 372450 rows and 785 columns,
